## Installation

### Using cargo

```shell
cargo install manga-tui
```

### AUR

You can install `manga-tui` from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/manga-tui) with using an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers).

```shell
paru -S manga-tui
```

## Binary release

Download a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/josueBarretogit/manga-tui/releases/latest)

## Image rendering

Use a terminal that can render images such as Wezterm (Personally I recommend using this one It's the one used in the videos), iTerm2 or Kitty, <br />

For more information see : [image-support](https://github.com/benjajaja/ratatui-image?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility-matrix)

No images will be displayed if the terminal does not have image support (but `manga-tui` will still work as a manga downloader)

## Usage

After installation run the binary

```shell
manga-tui
```

Manga downloads and reading history is stored in the `manga-tui` directory, to know where it is run: 


```shell
manga-tui --data-dir 

# or

manga-tui -d
```

On linux it will output something like: `~/.local/share/manga-tui` <br />

On the `manga-tui` directory there will be 3 directories
- `history`, which contains a sqlite database to store reading history
- `mangaDownloads`, where manga will be downloaded 
- `errorLogs`, for storing posible errors / bugs 

If you want to change the location you can set the environment variable `MANGA_TUI_DATA_DIR` to some path pointing to a directory, like: <br />

```shell
export MANGA_TUI_DATA_DIR="/home/user/Desktop/mangas"
```


## Configuration

By default `manga-tui` will search mangas in english, you can change the language by running:


```shell
# `es` corresponds to the Iso code for spanish
manga-tui lang --set 'es'
```

Check the available languages and their Iso codes by running:


```shell
manga-tui lang --print
```

## Motivation
I wanted to make a "How linux user does ..." but for manga, [here is the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0FsGRqEc1c) also this is a great excuse to start reading manga again
